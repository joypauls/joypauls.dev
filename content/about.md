ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Joy Paulsen (pronouns: they/them) and I live in [Minnepolis, MN](https://goo.gl/maps/WcAuj4o94y2mRfab9).

### Work

**I am a Senior Data Scientist and technical lead working in the logistics space at [C.H. Robinson](https://www.chrobinson.com/en-us/technology/robinson-labs/).** I've had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of problems, including:

* Both customer-facing and internally-focused recommendation systems
* Long-term pricing and supply/demand forecasting
* Developing performant production ML applications in many contexts
