In my free time (and with clear skies) I'm usually staring into space, collecting data with a telescope and camera, creating images like the one below:

<!-- ![The Heart Nebula (IC 1805)](/images/heart_nebula_hho.jpg "The Heart Nebula (IC 1805)") -->

{{< rawhtml >}}
<figure>
  <img src="/images/heart_nebula_hho.jpg" style="max-width: 500px">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: medium;">The Heart Nebula (IC 1805)</figcaption>
</figure>
