ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Joy Paulsen (pronouns are [they/them](https://pronoun.is/they/)), a data scientist and engineer specializing in personalization and recommendation systems living in Minnepolis, MN. Currently working on personalization at [Target](https://tech.target.com/).


In my free time (when the skies are clear) you can find me out at night with a telescope and camera, collecting data and creating images like the ones below:

<!-- ![The Heart Nebula (IC 1805)](/images/heart_nebula_hho.jpg "The Heart Nebula (IC 1805)") -->

<figure style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: medium;">The Heart Nebula (IC 1805)</figcaption>
</figure>
